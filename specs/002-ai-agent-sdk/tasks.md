- ## Final Phase: Polish & Cross-Cutting
- 
- - [ ] T027 Phase Final: Documentation polish and cross-cutting concerns (docs/, README.md)
- - [ ] T028 Phase Final: Linting/formatting and pre-commit hooks (lint) and CI checks
- - [ ] T029 Phase Final: Validation checklist generation and summary report (specs/002-ai-agent-sdk/tasks.md)
- 
- ## Dependencies & Execution Order
- 
- - Phase 1 must complete before Phase 2.
- - Phase 2 must complete before Phase 3 (US1-US5).
- - US1 must precede US2; US2 precedes US3-US4-US5 where applicable.
- - US3-US4-US5 can proceed in parallel where there are no cross-dependencies within their phases.
- - Final Polish depends on all prior phases.
- 
- ## Parallel Execution Opportunities
- 
- - Phase 2 tasks could be executed in parallel where not depending on each other (T004, T005, T006, T007, T008, T009).
- - US2 tasks (T014, T015) can run in parallel with T016.
- - US4 tasks (T021, T022) can run in parallel with US3 tasks (T018, T019) where appropriate.
- 
- ## MVP Scope
- - Phase 3 US1 tasks cover MVP: SDK initialization and configuration.
